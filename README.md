## 📘 Learning & Reflection

### a. What was the most challenging part for you?
Setting up the form submission without using PHP since Netlify uses static hosting.

### b. How did you solve it?
I used ChatGPT and Netlify documentation to learn about the `data-netlify="true"` attribute and how to capture form submissions through Netlify's dashboard.

### c. What did you learn during this task?
I learned how to deploy a static HTML site with Netlify, how form handling works without a backend, and how to structure a portfolio for real-world use.

### d. If we ask you to improve it tomorrow, what would you add?
I’d add dark/light theme toggle, smooth animations using AOS.js or GSAP, and make the form error handling more dynamic using JavaScript.

### e. What is your goal for the next 3 months if selected?
I plan to learn React.js and TailwindCSS deeply, build more full-stack projects using Firebase or Laravel, and contribute to open source for real-world experience.
